With Git:

With a new branch called new-design, edit the code directly without impacting the main branch
EMERGENCY! There is an unrelated error somewhere else in the project that needs to be fixed ASAP!
Create a new branch from the main project called small-error-fix
Fix the unrelated error and merge the small-error-fix branch with the main branch
You go back to the new-design branch, and finish the work there
Merge the new-design branch with main (getting alerted to the small error fix that you were missing)
Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch.

When the work is complete, a branch can be merged with the main project.

You can even switch between branches and work on different projects without them interfering with each other.

Branching in Git is very lightweight and fast!
 OKAY I'M JUST TRYING ADD SOME CHANGES.
